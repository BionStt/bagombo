## Notes:
### * Not finished at all
### * Working on 0.2 Features for release
### * Working on getting a live instance running on AWS
### * I'll add instructions for getting it running using EF Code First with how to do the initial migration
### * I use the user-secrets store now for the DB Connection string and I'm developing it using SQL Server 2016 Developer Edition
### * It would be nice to test it with other databases as they add support for EF Core
### * Basic features not in place
### * Plan on upgrading project to VS 2017 in a few months
### * Plan on adding unit tests using NUnit
### * Plan on integrating with AppVeyor
### * First ASP.NET Project for me, anticipate many updates
